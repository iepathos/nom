This repository is a collection of my cross-platform devops bash scripts.

Shell is kind of hideous imo and I'm not very fond of comments, but I try to keep my logic straight-forward.  If you're in this repo, good luck.

I've tried a lot of different devops tools for setup and lately I've come to believe simple shell scripts organized in a simple setup with small tools over everything is the easiest to debug and keep compatible across a bunch of different operating systems.  Maybe this just means I've finally crossed over to the dark side and have become the shell, idk, but I actively use these scripts across multiple OSX and Ubuntu machines.
